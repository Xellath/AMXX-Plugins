Just bunch of ideas.
Let's take those that are good.
As You said before every new classes should be paid, so You should decide which one and how much :D

Frozen Golem

- He has 1/5 chance to slow down his enemies and make them screen a little blue
- On knife he is loading frozen bullets. [Works same as BERSERKER!]. Every bullet is freezing oponnents for a half of second

Code can be taken from frostnade. Whole code will fit this class.

- On knife he can use Dragon Breath. It is power similar to Flamethrower. He is starting to emit flames to the place where he is aiming. The breath lasts for 5 sec, and is consuming 5hp [10int = 1 hp more] from target each second
