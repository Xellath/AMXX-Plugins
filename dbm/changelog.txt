- Multiple natives were changed and a few new ones were added.
- Major crash bug regarding Berserkers ability was fixed.

- Ninja bonus movement speed should now reset immediately when Rush ends.
- Adjusted several classes stat scaling, making most of them balanced.
- Several formatting errors.

Added features:
- Option to add all statpoints, not just 1, 5 or 10 at a time.
- Language menu in the help menu.
- Pet follower cost can now be changed with a cvar (dbm_petfollower_cvar, default: 3).
- Clerics can now use weapons to heal fellow teammates by shooting towards them. All weapons, except for knives, will heal for 50% of the damage done -- whilst knives will heal for 100% of damage done.
- Monks have a 20% chance to disarm enemies when attacking.

I will carry on with requests shortly. Please report back if you find anything -- also, please screenshot it; I found some of the reports quite hard to grasp.
